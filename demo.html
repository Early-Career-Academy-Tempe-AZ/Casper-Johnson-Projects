    <div class="content" id="content2">
        <p>
            In a land, known only to myth and legend, the world has three guardians, the Guardians of Light.  <br>
            <blockquote><span style="color:blue;">The Sky</span>, vast, stretching higher and farther than any creature could travel.  <br>
            <span style="color:darkgoldenrod">The Sun</span>, bright and blazing, providing the warmth of life to the creatures
            of the land, and burning away the shadows.<br><span style="color:rebeccapurple">The Moon</span>, providing balance, the benign night
            to the sun's day, the pull and push of the waves, acting as an equal and opposite force.</blockquote>
            These three entities represented the forces of light, and brought life together.  This peace could not last long,
            for without pain and suffering there would be no value to life.  Thus, once every thousand years, the Sky was clouded
            by darkness, the Sun eclipsed blotted out by shadow, and the Moon eclipsed by evil, replaced by a red light, shining alone in
            the eternally night sky.  Great misfortune was brought to the creatures of the land during these times.  The trees of the
            forest slowly withered, leaving the land scared and the life empty. Many died of hunger, dehydration, or rampant illness.
            But this would not be the end.  For in the last moments of the Sky, the Sun, and the Moon's life, they gifted to the forest
            a child.  This child would grow to be the savior of the land, and piece together the broken fragments of the Sky, the Sun,
            and the Moon, creating them anew and vanquishing the evil.  If this child were to survive to fulfil it.  And so, not
            wanting to lose its control, the darkness sent its forces forth into the world to revenge the forest's remains in search
            of the child.  This was the legend, retold from generation to generation, and told to the child who would become a mighty
            hero.

            Idea:<br>
            I, like many people, love a good, story-driven game full of vibrant colors.  I, like many of may friends, also enjoy creating games.
            Watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYzPXprvl5Y-Sf0g4vX-m6g">Jacksepticeye</a> play Ori and the Blind Forest, I was instilled with a desire to create a game of similar scale, full of color and
            adventure.
